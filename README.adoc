(_cf._ <<main-establishment,main establishment>>),
*regardless of the actual location of processing*
. the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in any location where Member State law applies

== Article 5: Principles relating to processing of personal data

The controller is responsible ("accountability") for ensuring that personal data is:

. *lawfully, fairly and transparently* processed ("lawfulness, fairness and transparency").
. collected for *specific, explicit and legitimate* purposes
. *relevant* and *limited* to the specified purpose ("data minimization")
. accurate and kept up to date; inaccurate personal data *must be erased or updated without delay* ("accuracy")
. suitably anonymized; data subjects *must not be identifiable for longer than necessary*
.. Personal data may be archived for longer periods *in the public interest or for research purposes*
(see <<art89,Article 89>>) with the appropriate privacy safeguards
. *appropriately secured*; this includes protection against unauthorized access and data loss, destruction or other
damage ("integrity and confidentiality")

== Article 6: Lawfulness of processing

Data processing is *lawful* if at least one of the following applies:

[#art6-consent]
. the data subject has given <<consent,consent>> to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose
. processing is necessary to *fulfill a contract* with the data subject
. processing is *requested by the data subject* prior to entering into a contract
. processing is necessary to comply with the controller's *legal obligations*
footnoteref:[art6-2,The conditions for such processing are specified by European Union law;
Member States may introduce more specific requirements.]
. processing is necessary to protect the *vital interests of the data subject*
. processing is necessary to carry out an action *in the public interest* footnoteref:[art6-2]
. processing is necessary to *exercise an official authority* of the controller footnoteref:[art6-2]
. processing is necessary to pursue the interests of the controller or of a third party,
given that these interests do not infringe on the fundamental rights of the data subject,
*in particular, when the data subject is a child*.
.. This does not apply to processing carried out by public authorities.

If data processing occurs for purposes other than that for which the personal data was initially collected,
and *is not based on consent of the data subject* or on European Union or Member State law,
the controller *must take into account* (among other things) the following,
in order to determine whether the processing is compatible:

. any link between *the initial purpose* and the intended further processing
. the context of the data collection
. whether *"special personal data"* (see <<art9, Article 9>>) is processed
. whether personal data related to criminal convictions or offenses (see <<art10,Article 10>>) is processed
. *any possible consequences* of the intended further processing
. *any appropriate safeguards*; this includes *encryption* or *<<pseudonymization,pseudonymization>>*

[#art7]
== Article 7: Conditions for consent

If the lawfulness of data processing is *<<art6-consent,based on consent>>*,
the controller *must be able to clearly demonstrate* that the data subject has freely consented
to the processing of their personal data. Data subjects must be *clearly informed* when consent is required,
and *must be allowed to withdraw their consent* at any time;
withdrawal *must not be made any more difficult* than the initial request for consent.

Consent should not be "bundled up as a condition of service", unless it is *absolutely necessary*
footnote:[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/what-is-valid-consent[UK Information Commissioner's Office: What is valid consent?]];
if consent is required as part of the conditions for a contract, but *is not absolutely necessary* for its fulfillment,
it is not considered freely given.
